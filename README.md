# First_page
My first ever webpage, not to say this is exactly the first version, but this is where I am learning HTML and CSS currently (as of around Dec 2021) 

Do's and dont's:

DO:
- use what you like
- learn from this
- have a little nosey

DON'T:
- use the code in your repositries, projects or anything, without crediting me in some way (GitHub preferably)
- Sell the code without making significant change to it
- Sell the code without asking my permission

If you would like to contact me about how things work on the page, what things mean, or If you'd like to sell code which a significant proportion of which is mine, please contact me on [ thatnick404@gmail.com ] Thanks!
